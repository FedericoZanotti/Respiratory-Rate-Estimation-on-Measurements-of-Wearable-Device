# Respiratory Rate Estimation on Measurements of Wearable Device

**Source Code**:  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/FedericoZanotti/Respiratory-Rate-Estimation-on-Measurements-of-Wearable-Device/blob/master/HDA_project.ipynb)

In this project I have used a pulse oximiter to collect vital signs on myself. Then I developed a Deep Learning model capable of 
predicting my respiratory rate.
All the details are in the colab file and in the report in this github repository.
