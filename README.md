# Respiratory Rate Estimation on Measurements of Wearable Device

In this project I have used a pulse oximiter to collect vital signs on myself. Then I developed a Deep Learning model capable of 
predicting my respiratory rate.
All the details are in the colab file and in the report in this github repository.
